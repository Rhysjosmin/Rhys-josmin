                    <span class="DateAndPlace">September 2022  October 2022 ,  USA,Remote</span>
                    <br>As part of a team responsible for the website of the Computer Event at Don Bosco College of Engineering, I took the lead in redesigning the website's style, drawing on my intermediate web design skills and experience

                    <span class="DateAndPlace">December 2021 -February 2022,  USA,Remote</span>
                    <br>As part of a team of four, I played a leading role in managing and rendering over 4000 videos for this challenging but rewarding project. My responsibilities included meeting deadlines, effectively managing large projects, and creating NFTs which were shared on social media to increase engagement. Through this experience, I developed my skills in team collaboration, project management and a deeper understanding of the field of 3D animation

                    <br>I was part of the MiningpassNFT project, where I gained valuable knowledge and experience in the field of NFTs and their workings, despite the project not being launched. This experience came before my work on the YellowDuckNFT project and helped me to be better prepared for the next project

                    <br>I led the process of creating NFTs using Dall-E 2 AI, including idea generation, 3D modeling and sculpting, and revisions. Solved rendering errors and batch management issues, including incorporating VRM files for VR gaming. Developed skills in AI, 3D modeling, problem-solving, scripting, and VR gaming.
